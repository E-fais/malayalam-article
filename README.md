A simple static website that helps to learn git and git hub in malaylam for absolute beginners.
 I am focusing on creating a good content,  so i need help to make this website responsive and good looking. 
I am encouraging first timers to  contribute in this project.
You can add your contributions such as navbar, footer, css styling etc
